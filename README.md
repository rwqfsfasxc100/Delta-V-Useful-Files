This repo aims to collect interesting and useful saves and other stuff for Delta V

## Saves
Everything save - contains all player-accessible ships, equipment, and astrogation locations. Contains 1.2 billion in cash and 2 million in insurance so you can experiment to your heart's content. For those worried, save does not grant achievements or leaderboards.

1. Download the .dv file.
2. Go to the game's save location

   - Linux/ChromeOS: ~/.local/share/dV/ OR ~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/dV/ depending on installation method
   - OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/dV
3. Copy the save file over to this location
4. Rename the save to the number of a free slot
